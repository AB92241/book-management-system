Book Management System Using ReactJS
The project was made with the intention to make librarians and small book store owners who still use books to keep track of logs and book records. This allows them to reduce the time taken and increase efiiceny reducing workload and focusing more on other areas.
This was made using ReactJS and the MERN stack. Vite was used to deploy
It has features that allow to add new books to the record so the librarian or the owner can know what the store has available and and log feature that keeps track of borrower's name and the date it was borrowed and the date it has to be written.
Im looking foward to adding new features that makes it look better and give it a library vibe while also keeping it simple and fucntional.
